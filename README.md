#### CBCDS by Team Ragz 🐾

CBCDS is the hub for all coding and development work for the Cat Behavioural Change Detection System. Whether we’re working in Python, another programming language, or integrating software with sensors, this repository is where all tasks, scripts, and features come together. Every teammate can contribute, test, and review code, making it easy to collaborate, stay organised, and see progress in real time. This is the space where our ideas turn into working code, and where the team builds CBCDS together.
