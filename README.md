# CBCDS by Team Ragz 🐾

**Cat Behavioural Change Detection System (CBCDS)** monitors cats’ behaviour—feeding, water intake, litter box use, outdoor activity, and hiding—to detect early signs of health issues. Cats often hide discomfort, so CBCDS helps owners spot problems early.  

This repository is **our central hub for collaboration**, where all coding, scripts, and data analysis live. Every teammate can contribute, review, and learn together.
